# Rob1n - The Pentester's Sidekick

This script will run external scans on a target using some nmap scripts and some other tools. First it will do a port scan and then it will determine which scans to run depending on what ports are open. This is pretty much still a work in progress, and currently only supports port 80 and 443.
